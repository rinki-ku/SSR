# SSR

understanding-server-side-rendering-in-react

We will only use create-react-app and express server.

STEP 1 : create react app from scratch

# npm create-react-app server-side-rendering

STEP 2 : Go inside /server-side-rendering folder, Run from terminal

# npm install express

Create new folder /server. Inside /server folder, create two files : index.js and server.js

# node server/index.js

If everything goes fine, you should see server running on port 8080.
open localhost:8080 to see your server side rendered page.

# npm start

localhost:3000, for client side rendered pages.
